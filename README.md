This problem is based on the “Jumping Jim” maze problem (from “MAD MAZES: Intriguing Mind Twisters for Puzzle Buffs, Game Nuts and Other Smart People” by Robert Abbott).
Jumping Jim is about to begin his grand performance at the circus, but his jealous en- emy, Dastardly Dan, has restrung all the trampolines. The number on each trampoline indicates how tightly strung each one is; in other words, the number indicates how far Jim will have to move (horizontally or vertically, but NOT diagonally) when he bounces off the trampoline. Jim begins his routine by leaping onto the trampoline at the upper left. He must get to the Goal at the lower right, where he will take his bow. How can he get there?
